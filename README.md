# RTool
Remote administration tool controlled through a web panel. Stub/Client built in Java.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and robust framework for managing and monitoring remote computers (cross platform, MacOS, Windows, Linux) using an interactive web panel and stub builder.

How it works:
- Create a stub
- Run the stub on the remote machine
- Wait for the stub to make contact with the web panel
- Manage the entire machine from an interactive API-based reverse webhook control panel
